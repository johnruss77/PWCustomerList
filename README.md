Developed in .net core 5 - utilising WEB MVC API called from standard Razor pages/code behind, with JSon files to populate customers/location:

A few things in progress
  * Location was intended to be select drop down with location name, which would set location id of customer
  * JSon customers in the file were intended to be added/updated/removed as required from the file, but time scales didn't allow this
